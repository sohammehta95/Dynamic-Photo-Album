# Dynamic-Photo-Album
A Dynamic Photo Album using Javascript and Bootstrap

Check the website to see the live webpage
https://sohammehta95.github.io/Dynamic-Photo-Album/

The webpage is made completely responsive by using Bootstrap
1)  The navbar will collapse into a button
2) The photos will be organised into a grid structure based on device size

The page uses Handlebars(http://handlebarsjs.com/) and JQuery to create templates and show content into these templates dynamically from Javascript Objects
